            To make easy to use website for the college to conduct voting for different purposes<br>
            To reduce the amount of paper used to maintain voting record.In the current system,<br>
            To the user must be 18+ eligible for voting and the user have to visit physically to the centres to vote.<br>
            In the current system the team has to maintain the records manually,so the amount of paper used is more.<br>
            The current system needs a team to handle all the Voter details and conduct the voting process.<br>
            In Traditional way of conducting Election which involves More paperwork. That's Why we created a system to
            tackle the problem huge amount of paper requirement and make a revolution in the system That's why our
